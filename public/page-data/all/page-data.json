The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":10,"id":"ddbaf000-ff0c-4dcf-bce6-5b8a3324fee8"},{"categories":["on sale","sofas"],"name":"Sven Tan Matte","price":"1200","image":"../images/products/couch8.png","description":"You don’t have to go outside to be rugged. The Cigar rawhide sofa features a sturdy corner-blocked wooden frame and raw seams for that Malboro-person look. This brown leather sofa is cozy in a cottage, cabin, or a condo. And the leather (the leather!) becomes more beautiful with use: subtle character markings such as insect bites, healed scars, and grain variation reflects a real vintage. Saddle up and pass the remote.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":7,"id":"a3553c34-3f10-4201-8af9-c107e50b2506"}],"title":"all","type":"categoryPage"}}}
