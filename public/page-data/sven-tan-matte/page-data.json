The Cigar rawhide sofa features a sturdy corner-blocked wooden frame and raw seams for that Malboro-person look. This brown leather sofa is cozy in a cottage, cabin, or a condo. And the leather (the leather!) becomes more beautiful with use: subtle character markings such as insect bites, healed scars, and grain variation reflects a real vintage. Saddle up and pass the remote.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":7,"id":"1b661b2d-d863-4ac6-8ef3-09a03275b6de"},"title":"Sven Tan Matte","type":"itemPage","previous":null,"next":{"categories":["new arrivals","sofas"],"name":"Thetis Gray Love Seat","price":"900","image":"../images/products/couch7.png","description":"You know your dad’s incredible vintage bomber jacket? The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":10,"id":"c72fa4f4-f503-44ce-976f-64f2417ce2d5"}}}}
